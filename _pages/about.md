My name is Vicen√ß Rubies-Royo and I am a postdoctoral scholar in the [Hybrid Systems Lab](http://hybrid.eecs.berkeley.edu/) which is part of [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley working on robotic safety and verification of AI systems. My work focuses on learning-based approaches for reachability analysis, neural network verification and analysis, and game-theoretic (inverse) path planning. I am particularly interested on how to incorporate high-dimensional observations to these types of problems and improving their scalability.

I am originally from Barcelona. When I am not doing research I spend my time dancing, running, playing piano, playing DnD or hiking.
